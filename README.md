## Why it's Useful

This calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations. It can be used for quick calculations without the need for a physical calculator. The code is straightforward and serves as a good example for beginners learning to create GUI applications in Python.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the `GUICalculator.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `GUICalculator.py` is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the calculator:

    ```bash
    python GUICalculator.py
    ```
    
5. The calculator GUI will open, allowing you to perform calculations.

## How to Use

- Enter numbers using the numeric buttons (0-9).
- Use the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform arithmetic operations.
- Press the "Clear" button to reset the input.
- Press the "=" button to calculate and display the result.

## Dependencies
